My overdue attempts to understand [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), the language I've been tangentially using for my livecoding since 2020.

It is guaranteed of dubious quality, use at your own risk.

Puzzles etc from [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

## Dependencies (debian/ubuntu et al)
```
sudo apt-get install ghc
```
(and others, who I've forgotten because there was a lot of trial and error - will update if I work it out)

## How to Compile
```
ghc --make <file>.hs
```
